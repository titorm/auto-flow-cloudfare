## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fluxo_ai_automation.git
    cd fluxo_ai_automation
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    The project uses Cloudflare Workers for its backend. You'll need to set up your Cloudflare account and obtain the necessary credentials.

    First, log in to Cloudflare:
    ```bash
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

    Next, update the `wrangler.jsonc` file with your Cloudflare Account ID and a unique name for your project. You will also need to configure your AI Gateway credentials in the `[vars]` section.

    ```jsonc
    // wrangler.jsonc
    {
      // ...
      "name": "fluxo-ai-automation-your-name",
      "vars": {
        "CF_AI_BASE_URL": "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_GATEWAY_ID/openai",
        "CF_AI_API_KEY": "your-cloudflare-api-key"
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    This command will start the Vite frontend development server and the Wrangler server for the backend worker simultaneously. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
